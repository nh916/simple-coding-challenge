What are some ways to make websites faster? (Name as many different techniques as you can)

•	Enable compression with Gzip
•	Minify HTML, CSS, JS so the browser is not reading a lot of empty lines
•	Reduce page redirects
•	Avoid repainting a page with JS because repainting is costly on the client’s system and takes time
•	Use browser cache whenever possible so browser has things already and can avoid making more requests
•	Use CDN when possible for faster delivery from servers that are closer to them and may have better networks
•	Optimize and compress images that removes extra and unneeded metadata and uses compression algorithms to reduce the size but keep the quality and help the website load faster
•	A good web server with sufficient power and a good backend that has optimized algorithms that can respond fast
•	Start looking into chrome Network tab and see what is slowing it down and see if you can eliminate it, reduce its need, or load it in strategically


When would you use a NoSQL solution instead of SQL?

I would use a NoSQL instead of an SQL when I am unsure of the full structure of the data that I am inputting. 


What type of experience have you had working with e-commerce sites?

I have designed and developed a budgeting android application in 2019 written in Java and SQL with SQLite database. I have created a blogging webapp with Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. 


Task 1
Explain how you would copy/clone/ripp this page and make it work on your local environment. How you would minimize the errors? If you would need to eliminate a scripts explain why?

I would first view the page source and copy that into a text editor and open it in a web page and see the progress. Then link to the stylesheet and JavaScript from their website or go to the CSS and JS link from their website and copy it into a local file and link to it on my machine. The best way to be sure there are no errors are to test the program in different ways. There are some scripts that seem to be working to send data from the frontend to the backend and if I only want the look of the webpage then I will eliminate those. Also, I saw some scripts meant to gather data for analytics and those should to all be in the Google Tag Manager that already exists on the website because it would make the web page cleaner, more maintainable in the future, and easier to update.
